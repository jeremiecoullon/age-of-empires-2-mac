## Project Structure

- Collision layers: 1=Units, 2=Buildings, 4=Resources
- Team 0 = Player (Blue), Team 1 = AI (Red)
- All game state goes through GameManager singleton

## Learnings

### Phase 1A - Resource System Refactor

- **Always pass team parameter**: When refactoring to unified functions with team parameter (e.g., `add_resource(type, amount, team)`), must update ALL call sites. Easy to miss places like unit death, training completion.

- **Dictionary-based resources**: Works well in GDScript since dictionaries are passed by reference. But consider adding validation for unknown resource types to catch typos early.

- **Drop-off finding edge case**: If no valid drop-off exists, villager should wait in place (still in RETURNING state) rather than going IDLE and losing carried resources.

- **Building placement validation**: Both player and AI need to check resource collision, not just building collision. The AI's `_is_valid_building_position` initially missed resource checks.

- **TownCenter needs team-aware training**: When TownCenter trains villagers, it must use its own team for resource spending and population, not hardcode team 0. Otherwise AI Town Centers spend player resources.

- **Typed arrays in GDScript 4**: When using `Array[String]` as an export, don't assign with `= ["a", "b"]` - this creates an untyped array. Use `.assign(["a", "b"])` instead. Also use `.has()` instead of `in` operator for checking membership in typed arrays.

### Phase 1B - Animals & Food Sources

- **Animals don't add/remove population**: Animals extend Unit but should NOT be counted in population. Override die() completely rather than calling super.die() which would decrement population.

- **Neutral team = -1**: Wild/unowned animals use team = -1 (NEUTRAL_TEAM constant). Player = 0, AI = 1.

- **Preload scenes for runtime spawning**: When spawning scenes during gameplay (like carcasses on animal death), use `preload()` as a class constant rather than `load()` at runtime. Avoids file I/O during gameplay.

- **Throttle expensive tree searches**: Functions like `get_tree().get_nodes_in_group()` are O(n). Don't call them every frame. Use timers (e.g., check every 0.5s) for aggro detection, ownership checks, etc.

- **Store last known position before target dies**: When hunting/attacking a moving target, store their position each frame. When they die, you can find the carcass at the last known position even if the target node is already freed.

- **Animals aren't "units" in AoE2 spec**: The manual doesn't list HP/attack for sheep/deer/boar/wolf in the Unit Attributes appendix. They're resources/hazards, not combat units. Use reasonable placeholder values.

### Phase 1C - Basic Sprites

- **Sprite sheets need region_rect**: Tiny Swords assets are sprite sheets (multiple frames for animation). Use `region_enabled = true` and `region_rect = Rect2(x, y, w, h)` where (x,y) is top-left corner and (w,h) is frame size. For first frame: `Rect2(0, 0, frame_width, frame_height)`. Common frame sizes: units 192x192, sheep 128x128, trees 256x256. **Standalone files (SVGs, individual PNGs) should NOT use region_rect.**

- **Sprite scale calculation**: Target visual size in game pixels, then `scale = target / source_size`. Units typically 30-40px visual to match ~24px collision. Buildings 50-80px visual for 64-96px collision. Example: 192x192 sprite × 0.2 scale = 38px visual. Document your scale choice.

- **Vertical sprite offset for tall objects**: Use `position = Vector2(0, -y)` to visually center tall sprites (trees) when collision shape is at ground level. The sprite extends upward while collision stays at origin.

- **Standardized sprite paths for easy replacement**: Put sprites in `assets/sprites/{units,buildings,resources}/` with consistent names. To replace later: drop in new file with same name. Godot handles PNG/SVG the same way.

- **Team colors + pre-colored sprites = tinted result**: Current `_apply_team_color()` uses modulate to tint sprites. With pre-colored Blue sprites from Tiny Swords, AI units (red modulate on blue base) will look purple-ish. Proper fix: load team-specific sprites. Deferred for now.

- **SVG for placeholder sprites**: SVGs are text-based XML that Godot can import. Good for creating simple placeholder sprites (e.g., deer, boar, wolf) when asset pack doesn't have them. Will look flat compared to pixel art. Replace with matching pixel art before polish phase.

- **SelectionIndicator without texture**: SelectionIndicator nodes use `scale = Vector2(width, height)` as direct dimensions in game pixels (not multipliers) since they have no texture. Main sprites use scale as multipliers on texture dimensions.

- **Asset sources**: Tiny Swords pack: villager, militia, sheep, all buildings except farm, tree, berry_bush, gold_mine, stone_mine, food_carcass. Custom SVG placeholders: deer, boar, wolf, farm.
